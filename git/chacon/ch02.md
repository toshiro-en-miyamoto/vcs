# Chapter 2: Git Basics

This chapter covers every basic command you need to do the vast majority of the things you’ll eventually spend your time doing with Git. By the end of the chapter, you should be able to configure and initialize a repository, begin and stop tracking files, and stage and commit changes.

## `config`

```bash
~ $ git config --list --show-origin
file:/home/user/.gitconfig  user.email=your.email@sample.com
file:/home/user/.gitconfig  user.name=your name
file:/home/user/.gitconfig  credential.helper=store
```

## `clone`

```bash
$ cd ~/repo
$ git clone git@192.168.0.42:the-repo/vcs.git
Cloning into 'vcs'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 11, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (11/11), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
remote: Total 11 (delta 0), reused 8 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (11/11), 4.54 KiB | 1.13 MiB/s, done.

$ cd ~/repo/vcs
$ git config --list --show-origin
file:/home/user/.gitconfig  user.email=your.email@sample.com
file:/home/user/.gitconfig  user.name=your name
file:/home/user/.gitconfig  credential.helper=store
file:.git/config  core.repositoryformatversion=0
file:.git/config  core.filemode=true
file:.git/config  core.bare=false
file:.git/config  core.logallrefupdates=true
file:.git/config  remote.origin.url=git@192.168.0.42:the-repo/vcs.git
file:.git/config  remote.origin.fetch=+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
file:.git/config  branch.main.remote=origin
file:.git/config  branch.main.merge=refs/heads/main
file:.git/config  branch.main.vscode-merge-base=origin/main
```

## `status`

```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.vscode/
	git/chacon/commands.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: *tracked* or *untracked*:

- Tracked files are files that Git knows about.
- Untracked files are everything.

## `add`

To begin tracking files in the `.vscode` directory:

```bash
$ git add .vscode/

$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   .vscode/settings.json

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	git/chacon/commands.md
```

Upon editing `settings.json`, the status of the file changes from :

```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   .vscode/settings.json

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   .vscode/settings.json

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	git/chacon/commands.md
```

Git also has a short status flag so you can see your changes in a more compact way.

```bash
$ git status -s
AM .vscode/settings.json
?? git/chacon/commands.md
```

Git has three main states that your files can reside in: `modified`, `staged`, and `committed`:

- `modified` means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.
- `staged` means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.
- `committed` means that the data is safely stored in your local database.

This leads us to the three main sections of a Git project: the *working tree*, the *staging area*, and the Git directory.

- The working tree is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.
- The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. Its technical name in Git parlance is the **index**, but the phrase **staging area** works just as well.
- The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer.

If a particular version of a file is in the Git directory, it’s considered *committed*. If it has been modified and was added to the staging area, it is *staged*. And if it was changed since it was checked out but has not been staged, it is *modified*.

| pre-state   | operation | post-state
|-------------|-----------|------------
| untracked   | `add`     | `staged`
| `staged`    | `commit`  | `committed`
| `committed` | edit      | `modified`
| `staged`    | edit      | `modified`
| `modified`  | `add`     | `staged`

## `diff`

To see what you’ve changed but not yet staged, type `git diff` with no other arguments:

```bash
$ git diff
diff --git a/.vscode/settings.json b/.vscode/settings.json
index 261bc28..52ec4ca 100644
--- a/.vscode/settings.json
+++ b/.vscode/settings.json
@@ -1,7 +1,9 @@

     "logallrefupdates",
-    "repositoryformatversion"
+    "repositoryformatversion",
+    "unstage"
   ]
 }
\ No newline at end of file
```

`git diff --staged` compares your staged changes to your last commit:

```bash
$ git diff --staged
diff --git a/.vscode/settings.json b/.vscode/settings.json
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..261bc28

+  ]
+}
\ No newline at end of file
```

## `commit`

Before committing, make sure to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

```bash
$ git add .

$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   .vscode/settings.json
	new file:   git/chacon/commands.md

$ git commit -m "git commands first commit"
[main 9858ef9] git commands first commit
  2 files changed, 162 insertions(+)
  create mode 100644 .vscode/settings.json
  create mode 100644 git/chacon/commands.md
```

## `rm`

To remove a file from Git, you have to remove it from your tracked files (more accurately, remove it from your staging area) and then commit. The `git rm` command does that, and also removes the file from your working directory so you don’t see it as an untracked file the next time around.

```bash
$ git rm a_file
```

Another useful thing you may want to do is to keep the file in your working tree but remove it from your staging area. In other words, you may want to keep the file on your hard drive but not have Git track it anymore. This is particularly useful if you forgot to add something to your `.gitignore` file and accidentally staged it, like a large log file or a bunch of `.a` compiled files. To do this, use the `--cached` option:

```bash
$ git rm --cached hello.a
```

Use this option to unstage and remove paths only from the index. Working tree files, whether modified or not, will be left alone.

## `mv`

```bash
$ git mv file_from file_to
```

This is equivalent to running something like this:

```bash
$ mv file_from file_to
$ git rm file_from
$ git add file_to
```

## `log`

`git log` lists each commit with its SHA-1 checksum, the author’s name and email, the date written, and the
commit message.

```bash
$ git log
commit 9858ef93c56719065fcc37e31cc4554a85f36a0a (HEAD -> main)
Author: your name <your.email@sample.com>
Date:   Mon Sep 2 19:04:29 2024 +0800

    git commands first commit
```

One of the more helpful options is `-p` or `--patch`, which shows the difference (the patch output) introduced in each commit.

```bash
$ git log --patch
commit 9858ef93c56719065fcc37e31cc4554a85f36a0a (HEAD -> main)
Author: your name <your.email@sample.com>

If you want to see some abbreviated stats for each commit, you can use the `--stat` option:

```bash
$ git log --stat
commit 9858ef93c56719065fcc37e31cc4554a85f36a0a (HEAD -> main)
Author: your name <your.email@sample.com>

Another really useful option is `--pretty`. This option changes the log output to formats other than the default. A few prebuilt option values are available for you to use. The `oneline` value for this option prints each commit on a single line, which is useful if you’re looking at a lot of commits.

```bash
$ git log --pretty=oneline
9858ef93c56719065fcc37e31cc4554a85f36a0a (HEAD -> main) git commands first commit
860d484d3b898a18706a16ad77658c4cdd78dfb6 (origin/main, origin/HEAD) migrated from build repo
7b3561fc5087867be111d72d39073f44a618df3c Initial commit
```

The most interesting option value is `format`, which allows you to specify your own log output format.

```bash
$ git log --pretty=format:"%h %cd %s"
9858ef9 Mon Sep 2 19:04:29 2024 +0800 git commands first commit
860d484 Sun Oct 16 15:09:34 2022 +0800 migrated from build repo
7b3561f Sun Oct 16 15:07:28 2022 +0800 Initial commit
```

The `oneline` and `format` option values are particularly useful with another log option called `--graph`. This option adds a nice little ASCII graph showing your branch and merge history:

```bash
$ git log --pretty=format:"%h %s" --graph
* 2d3acf9 Ignore errors from SIG on trap
* 5e3ee11 Merge branch 'master' of ...
|\
| * 420eac9 Add method for getting the current branch
* | 30e367c Timeout code and tests
```

## `remote`

```bash
$ git remote --verbose
origin	git@192.168.0.42:the-repo/vcs.git (fetch)
origin	git@192.168.0.42:the-repo/vcs.git (push)

$ git remote show origin
* remote origin
  Fetch URL: git@192.168.0.42:the-repo/vcs.git
  Push  URL: git@192.168.0.42:the-repo/vcs.git
  HEAD branch: main
  Remote branch:
    main tracked
  Local branch configured for 'git pull':
    main merges with remote main
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    main pushes to main (fast-forwardable)
```

## `push`

`git push` updates remote refs along with associated objects:

```
git push [<repository> [<refspec>...]]
```

Don't forget to stage the changes made and commit it.

```bash
$ git add .

$ git commit -m "git commands up to push"
[main b425d74] git commands up to push
 2 files changed, 200 insertions(+)

$ git push

   860d484..b425d74  main -> main
```

When the command line does not specify where to push with the `repository` argument, `branch.*.remote` configuration for the current branch is consulted to determine where to push. If the configuration is missing, it defaults to `origin`.

```bash
$ git config --list --local
core.repositoryformatversion=0
core.filemode=true
core.bare=false
core.logallrefupdates=true
remote.origin.url=git@192.168.0.42:the-repo/vcs.git
remote.origin.fetch=+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
branch.main.remote=origin
branch.main.merge=refs/heads/main
branch.main.vscode-merge-base=origin/main
```

## `tag`

Listing the existing tags in Git is straightforward.

```bash
$ git tag
v1.0
v2.0
```

Git supports two types of tags: *lightweight* and *annotated*.

- A lightweight tag is very much like a branch that doesn’t change &mdash; it’s just a pointer to a specific commit.
- Annotated tags, however, are stored as full objects in the Git database. They’re check-summed; contain the tagger name, email, and date; have a tagging message; and can be signed and verified with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG).

Creating an annotated tag in Git is simple. The easiest way is to specify `-a` when you run the `tag` command. The `-m` specifies a tagging message, which is stored with the tag. If you don’t specify a message for an annotated tag, Git launches your editor so you can type it in.

```bash
$ git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"
```

Another way to tag commits is with a lightweight tag. This is basically the commit checksum stored in a file &mdash; no other information is kept. To create a lightweight tag, don’t supply any of the `-a`, `-s`, or `-m` options, just provide a tag name:

```bash
$ git tag v1.4-lw
```

You can also tag commits after you’ve moved past them. Now, suppose you forgot to tag the project at v1.2, which was at a commit checksum (say, `9fceb02d0ae...`). You can add it after the fact.

```bash
$ git tag -a v1.2 -m "my version 1.2" 9fceb02
```

By default, the `git push` command doesn’t transfer tags to remote servers. You will have to explicitly push tags to a shared server after you have created them.

```bash
$ git push origin v1.5
```
